Absolutely — here's the **regenerated prompt** for your **User Management App**, now explicitly including the **Super User (Super Admin)** role and its responsibilities.

---

### ✅ **Prompt: User Management App with Role, App Access Control, and Super User Role**

> **Design and build a User Management App** that allows organizations to manage users, assign roles, control access to multiple apps/modules, and delegate administrative functions — with a secure Super User role overseeing the entire system.

---

### 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization**

* User signup, login, logout
* Email verification and password reset
* **Role-based access control**
* **App/module-based access control**:

  * Assign specific apps/modules each user can access
  * Optional: assign roles *per app* (e.g., Manager for CRM, Viewer for HR)
* **Super User (Super Admin) access**:

  * Full control over all users, roles, and apps
  * Ability to manage other admins
  * View full audit trails
  * Create/edit/delete roles and apps

---

### 🧑‍💼 **Admin & Super Admin Dashboard**

* View/search/filter all users
* Add/edit/delete user accounts
* Assign/modify:

  * **User roles**
  * **Accessible apps/modules**
* Bulk user actions
* Scoped permissions:

  * Regular Admins have limited scope (e.g., app-specific or department-specific)
  * **Super Admins** can manage all aspects of the system

---

### 👤 **User Profile**

* Users can view and update personal info
* Upload profile picture
* Change password
* View assigned roles and apps

---

### 📊 **Audit Logs & Activity Tracking**

* Track critical actions:

  * Login/logout
  * Role/app assignments
  * User updates or deletions
* **Super Admins** have full visibility
* Admins may have scoped or limited access to logs

---

### 🌐 **Multi-App / Multi-Tenant Support**

* Define multiple apps/modules (e.g., CRM, HR, Analytics)
* Assign app-level access to users
* Support for:

  * Role-per-app (e.g., Admin in CRM, Viewer in HR)
  * User access limited to specific apps

---

### 🖥️ **Responsive UI**

* Fully responsive design (desktop + mobile)
* Super Admin panel
* Admin panel (limited)
* User dashboard

---

### 🔧 **Technical Considerations**

* **Frontend:** React, Vue, or similar SPA framework
* **Backend:** Node.js, Django, Laravel, or any REST/GraphQL API
* **Auth:** JWT, OAuth2, 2FA for Super Admins
* **Database:** Structured to support many-to-many relationships between Users, Roles, and Apps
* **Security Best Practices:** Password hashing, access guards, logging, audit trails

---

### 🗂️ Suggested Data Model (Simplified)

#### Entities:

* **User**
* **Role** (`SuperAdmin`, `Admin`, `Manager`, `Viewer`, etc.)
* **App** (`CRM`, `HR`, `Analytics`, etc.)
* **UserRoleApp** (pivot table connecting users, roles, and apps)

| user_id | role_id    | app_id    |
| ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| 1       | SuperAdmin | *         |
| 2       | Admin      | CRM       |
| 3       | Manager    | HR        |
| 4       | Viewer     | Analytics |

---

### 🛡️ Role Hierarchy (Example)

```
Super Admin
│
├── Admin (scoped to certain apps or teams)
│   └── Can manage users within assigned apps
│
└── Regular Users
    ├── Manager
    └── Viewer
```

---

TODO : generate from chatgpt or any other tool
* A database schema diagram?
* A mock UI for the Super Admin dashboard?
* Role-based API route permissions?
